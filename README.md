# hello-world 

hey guys,

I'm Earl Junior and i like to learn, I'm new to this but my goal is to be the best of the best.
I reside in New York and wish to network and work my way into the "coding" world.
I would like a mentor that has experience and knowledge.
Im currently working on a two wheel robot using an arduino R3 with an ultrasonic module and to code the arduino im using a raspberry pi3 running debian Jessie with raspberry pi desktop.
